Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
$t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$). The description of each test case follows.

Each test case begins with a single line with an integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$).

The next line contains $n - 1$ integers, $p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n$ ($-1 \leq p_i < i, p_i \neq 0$).
If $p_i = -1$, node $i$ has no parent. Otherwise, node $i$ is a child of node $p_i$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$.
