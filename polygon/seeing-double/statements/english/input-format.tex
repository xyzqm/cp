Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
$t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$). The description of each test case follows.

Each test case contains a single line with a string $s$ ($1 \leq |s| \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $|s|$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.
